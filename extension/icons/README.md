# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon32.png` (32x32 pixels) 
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Creating Icons

You can create simple icons using any image editor or use online tools like:

1. **Favicon generators** - Convert any image to the required sizes
2. **Online icon makers** - Create simple icons from scratch
3. **Design tools** - Use Figma, Canva, or similar tools

## Icon Requirements

- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Style**: Simple, recognizable design
- **Colors**: Should work well on both light and dark browser themes
- **Branding**: Should represent ScrollMine (book/scroll theme)

## Quick Solution

For now, you can use any simple icon or create a basic one with:
- A book emoji (ðŸ“š) 
- A scroll emoji (ðŸ“œ)
- Or any simple geometric shape

## Temporary Icons

If you don't have icons yet, you can:

1. Create a simple colored square as a placeholder
2. Use an online favicon generator with a book emoji
3. Download free icons from sites like Flaticon or Icons8

The extension will work without icons, but they improve the user experience.
